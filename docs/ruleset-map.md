# ðŸ§­ RuleSet Threat Mapping - auditd (arch-secure-admin)

This document provides a strategic overview of the syscall-based auditd rules in the `arch-secure-admin` project. It maps each rule to its corresponding threat model, syscall or file target, and provides operational context for manual log review, incident detection, and system forensics.

## ðŸ“Š Rule Mapping Table

| Threat Description            | Monitored Action / Target                          | Source / Risk Origin       | RuleSet File                             | Tag (`-k`)                    |

| VPN deactivation / bypass     | Execution of `wg`, `wg-quick`, `nmcli` commands    | User/script disabling VPN  | `31-wireguard.rules`                     | `wireguard`                   |
| WireGuard config modification | Write to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`                 | Root / malicious change    | `31-wireguard.rules`                     | `wireguard_config`            |
| Routing manipulation          | Syscalls: `clone`, `unshare`, `setrlimit`          | Advanced evasion script    | `31-wireguard.rules`                     | `wireguard_route`             |
| DNS-over-HTTPS override (DoH) | Edit Firefox/Chrome DoH configuration files        | User extension or malware  | `32-dns-leaks.rules`                     | `doh_attempt`                 |

## ðŸ§  Usage

* Each tag (`-k`) can be used with `ausearch -k <tag>` to filter relevant events
* This mapping helps prioritize alerts, identify misuse patterns, and correlate low-level actions with higher-level risks
* Especially useful in air-gapped or VPN-only environments where trust boundaries are enforced strictly
